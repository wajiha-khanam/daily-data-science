# 🧠 Daily Data Science Challenges

Welcome! This repository is my personal daily practice log for sharpening data science skills using Python. Each day, I solve:

- 🐼 1 Pandas manipulation challenge  
- 📊 1 Data visualization task  
- 📂 1 small dataset-based analysis or EDA

My goal is to build consistency, deepen my understanding of real-world data, and stay sharp with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. All code is written in Jupyter Notebooks and organized by day.
